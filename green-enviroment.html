    <p class="paragraph-2">     As a technology company, the direct environmental impacts of FPT&#x27;s operations and business activities are negligible. Therefore, when investing in building office complexes, training facilities, and software parks, FPT prioritizes the application of new technologies, environmentally friendly materials, and maximizing the use of natural energy sources, as well as increasing green space to minimize environmental impact, energy consumption, and waste.<br></p>
    <div class="div-block-20"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-2">     Regarding greenhouse gas emissions, according to Decree No. 06/2022/ND-CP on greenhouse gas emission reduction and ozone layer protection, from 2023, facilities consuming 1,000 TOE (Tons of Oil Equivalent) or more will have to inventory and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According to preliminary statistics from FPT-owned buildings, the average electricity consumption is about 4 million kWh, equivalent to 700 TOE. Currently, FPT has not conducted greenhouse gas emission measurements. However, this is a top priority for FPT when investing in office buildings and campuses nationwide. In the coming period, FPT will continue to implement initiatives and measures to minimize and evaluate this indicator.<br><br>     FPT has been applying several measures to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, such as installing solar power systems, using digital technology to increase online meetings, limiting the use of office supplies, digitizing documents and data, and regularly promoting energy-saving practices through posters in necessary areas.<br><br>     Developing Green Technology Solutions<br>Based on the latest technology trends such as AI, Big Data, Cloud, IoT, and RPA, FPT has developed and provided solutions to help businesses globally, as well as FPT itself, move towards a green enterprise model that minimizes environmental impact.<br><br>     For example, FPT&#x27;s energy-saving smart manufacturing solutions are being effectively deployed by many partners. A traditional manufacturing plant in Vietnam, owned by a German automotive industry company with 77 plants worldwide, is using FPT&#x27;s smart factory solution to optimize production, logistics, and operations, reducing emissions and energy consumption. After three years of implementation, this has become their most modern plant globally, and they plan to close several European plants to focus on expanding the scale of the Vietnam plant.<br><br>     A European energy company, leading in renewable energy, is implementing FPT&#x27;s technology solutions for optimizing wind power management and maintenance of wind energy farms.<br><br>     In the electric vehicle sector, one of the important tasks is setting up charging stations along roads. FPT is helping develop software for managing charging station systems and embedded software for charging stations to optimize energy management and consumption.<br><br>Internal Digital Transformation</p>
    <div class="div-block-21"></div>
    <p class="paragraph-2">     Not only does FPT provide solutions to help other businesses move towards a green enterprise model, but it also promotes internal digital transformation to optimize operations, indirectly reducing environmental impacts. Most of FPT&#x27;s administrative and operational activities have been digitized, moving towards a paperless enterprise model with online task assignment, electronic invoicing, online procurement management, online payment management, online performance evaluation, and other internal online services. In particular, FPT signed over 70,000 electronic contracts in 2022, accounting for about 40% of all contracts signed and a 20% increase compared to 2021.<br><br>     The group also encourages employees to use public transportation, shuttle buses, and technology solutions for online meetings to replace business trips, reducing carbon emissions from personal vehicles. In 2022, the group&#x27;s online meeting software recorded approximately 4,500 meetings.<br><br>     FPT&#x27;s Building Operations to Minimize Environmental Impact :<br>‍<br>       Increasing the use of natural energy/water sources such as solar energy, groundwater, and rainwater.<br><br>       Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by lowering energy consumption in FPT-owned office buildings nationwide.<br><br>       Using smart control systems for electrical and water devices.<br><br>       Closely monitoring monthly electricity consumption.<br><br>       Regularly cleaning heat exchange units, especially air-cooled heat exchangers, to prevent dust accumulation that reduces heat exchange efficiency.<br><br>       Timely maintenance and repair to prevent energy loss in the system.<br><br>       Replacing local hot water heaters with centralized hot water supply systems using solar energy.<br><br>       Employing professional staff to manage and operate air conditioning and ventilation systems scientifically and effectively, achieving high energy-saving efficiency</p>
